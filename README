Simplified PUB/SUB with node.js:

- Binds into a redis channel called PUBSUB:COMET
- send everything received by this channel straight to connected users
- used COMET as transport

test with curl or any browser (some browsers as safari and chrome has a minimum buffer to fill before showing comet data)

start redis and run pubsub_comet:
$ node pubsub_comet.js

in another term
$ curl http://localhost:8080/subscribe

now publish messages to redis:

$ redis-cli
> PUBLISH PUBSUB:COMET hello

check curl's output and note that the connection still there.

also, use publisher.js to test a stream of search results from twitter to your users.

$ node publisher.js

if you keep getting too many open files error, try: 
$ launchctl limit maxfiles 1000000 1000000
